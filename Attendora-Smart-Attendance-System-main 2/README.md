**Attendora** is an enterprise-grade, cross-platform smart attendance management application built with **Flutter** and **Firebase**. It eliminates proxy attendance using **time-bound dynamic QR codes**, **real-time GPS geofencing**, **hardware single-device locking**, and **multi-tenant role-based access control (RBAC)**.

## 📖 Detailed Local Setup Guide

Follow this comprehensive guide to set up, configure, and run **Attendora** locally on your development environment.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have installed:

| Tool | Recommended Version | Download / Guide |
|---|---|---|
| **Flutter SDK** | `3.3.0` or higher (channel stable) | [flutter.dev/get-started](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) |
| **Dart SDK** | Included with Flutter | Built-in |
| **Android Studio** (or VS Code) | Latest version | [developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) |
| **Google Chrome** | Latest (for Web testing) | [google.com/chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) |
| **Firebase CLI** *(Optional)* | Latest | `npm install -g firebase-tools` |

Verify that your Flutter environment is healthy:
```bash
flutter doctor
```
*(Ensure that Flutter, Android toolchain, and Chrome checks pass without critical issues).*

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kshitiz/Attendora-Smart-Attendance-System.git
cd Attendora-Smart-Attendance-System
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

Download and link all Dart and Flutter packages declared in `pubspec.yaml`:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

### 4. Firebase Setup & Configuration

Attendora uses Firebase for Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and Hosting.

The project comes with a pre-configured `firebase_options.dart` and Firebase configuration files (`firebase.json`, `firestore.rules`, `firestore.indexes.json`).

> **💡 Note for Custom Firebase Projects:**
> If you want to use your own Firebase backend project:
> 1. Install FlutterFire CLI: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`
> 2. Log in to Firebase: `firebase login`
> 3. Run configuration in root directory:
>    ```bash
>    flutterfire configure
>    ```
> 4. Deploy Firestore rules and indexes:
>    ```bash
>    firebase deploy --only firestore
>    ```

---

### 5. Running the Application

You can run Attendora across multiple platforms:

#### 🌐 Running on Web (Google Chrome)
```bash
# Standard Chrome web runner
flutter run -d chrome

# High-performance CanvasKit rendering engine (recommended for rich UI):
flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer canvaskit
```

#### 📱 Running on Android (Emulator or Physical Device)
1. Ensure your physical phone is connected via USB with **USB Debugging enabled**, or launch an Android Virtual Device (AVD) from Android Studio.
2. List available target devices:
   ```bash
   flutter devices
   ```
3. Run on your selected device:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d <device-id>
   # Or simply:
   flutter run
   ```

#### 🍏 Running on iOS (macOS only)
```bash
flutter run -d ios
```

#### 🖥️ Running on Desktop (Linux / macOS / Windows)
```bash
flutter run -d linux      # On Linux
flutter run -d macos      # On macOS
flutter run -d windows    # On Windows
```

---

### 6. Building for Production

#### 🌐 Build Web App:
```bash
flutter build web --release
```
*Generated output will be available in `build/web/` for deployment (Firebase Hosting, Vercel, Netlify, or Nginx).*

#### 📱 Build Android APK:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```
*Generated APK will be located at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.*

#### 📦 Build Android App Bundle (AAB for Google Play Store):
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### 📍 1. Dynamic Rolling QR Codes
* Generates fresh QR payloads every 5 seconds with cryptographically signed timestamps.
* Prevents screenshotting, photographing, or sharing QR codes across messaging apps.

### 🛡️ 2. Hardware GPS Geofencing
* Teachers specify an allowable attendance radius (e.g., 50 meters around the lecture hall).
* Student coordinates are verified against the session anchor coordinates before marking presence.

### 🔒 3. Single-Device Hardware Binding
* Prevents "buddy punching" by associating a student's account with their device identifier.
* Multiple concurrent student logins on the same device are immediately flagged.

## 👥 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The application provides dedicated dashboards and permissions for each role:

| Role | Key Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **👑 Super Admin** | Global system health monitoring, multi-tenant institution provisioning, system settings, global notification broadcasts, and audit logs. |
| **🏫 Institution Admin** | Department and course administration, faculty and student onboarding, schedule approvals, and batch analytics reports. |
| **👨‍🏫 Teacher** | Start dynamic QR sessions with customizable geofence radiuses, live attendee streams, manual attendance overrides, and CSV/PDF report exports. |
| **🎓 Student** | High-speed camera QR scanner with real-time GPS proximity feedback, attendance logs, monthly summaries, and subject-wise analytics. |
